Files for Google gadgets.

For ease of maintenance each gadget should be in its own directory.

Call any shared libs etc directly, not relatively.

Do not send the XML for these straight to iGoogle etc; instead use:

moodleurl/local/snapp/gadgetserv/gadgetxml?gurl=local/gadgets/yourfolder/yourgadget.xml
